    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I began my emplyment journey working in retail for Coles supermarkets....
        <br>   <br>
        I have worked the last 10 years in the RAAF as an Air Surveillance Operator doing various roles such as Simulation Pilot, working with various radar & satelite surveillance systems and doing various humanitarian deployments.
        <br>   <br>
        My passion has always been with computers, and for a few years I dabbled around with coding creating little apps and websites here and there before deciding this is what I want to do. I decided to go back to studying and do my diploma of Computer Science: Web Development. 
        <br>   <br>
        I am now embarking on the next stage of my emplyment journey as a Full stack developer where I hope to help people and businesses fulfil their visions by creating robust platforms for them to get their product out to their target customer base.
